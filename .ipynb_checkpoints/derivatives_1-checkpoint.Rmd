## R Markdown



```{r mexican}
# Create a list of dates and values
date = as.Date(c("2022-03-23", "2022-04-23", "2022-05-23", "2022-06-23", "2022-07-23",  "2022-08-23"))
df_mex <- data.frame(
          date,
          value = c(.05429, .05392, .05364, 12, 20)
)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
